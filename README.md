# snake-nn
* Snake game written in JavaScript using `p5.js`. 
* **The gaming part**: OK ready to play.
* **The neural network part**: extremely overfitted (since I only used a very small amount of data generated by playing the game myself) and shitty (since I did this when I had 0 knowledge on NNs).
* I keep this since it reminds me of my past.
